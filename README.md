# Docker Template

Run `bash init.sh` (or `bash init.sh <project-name>`)

This will `poetry new <project-name>` and create a directory structure under the `app` folder (on docker it is created under the `workspace` folder).

The environment is now complete - open the container on vscode and start developing!
